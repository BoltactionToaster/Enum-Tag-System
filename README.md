# Enum Tag System
This is a Unity Editor tool to add an additional tag system to Unity that allows you to select multiple tags. Currently in VERY early access.

As it stands, it adds a component to any individual object you select so if you don't want it to add one to every object, be sure to edit the editor script!

To use this early version, just copy/paste the scripts under the folder Enum Input System to your assets folder.
